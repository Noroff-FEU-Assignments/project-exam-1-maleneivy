I was tasked with making a blog site with a theme of my own choice. 
The criterias was to have at least five pages:

The content for the blog is stored at Wordpress and making a call to the REST Api and fetching the data. 

## Description of the blog site

Theme for the site is healthy food and want to put a focus on animal welfare.
